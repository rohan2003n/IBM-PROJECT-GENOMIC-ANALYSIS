Genomic Data Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
The Genomic Data Analysis Dashboard is a Streamlit-based interactive application designed for analyzing genomic datasets. This tool provides advanced data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and machine learning-based classification to facilitate meaningful insights from genomic data.

🚀 Features
Intuitive File Upload: Supports CSV genomic datasets
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables
Dimensionality Reduction: Implements PCA & t-SNE for visualization
Feature Selection: Utilizes the Chi-Square test for key feature identification
Machine Learning Model: Trains a Random Forest Classifier for prediction
Performance Metrics: Displays accuracy scores and classification reports
Interactive Visualization: Graphical representations of PCA and t-SNE transformations
