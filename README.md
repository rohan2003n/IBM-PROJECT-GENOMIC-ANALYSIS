# Genomic Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
The *Genomic Data Analysis Dashboard* is a Streamlit-based interactive application designed for analyzing genomic datasets. This tool provides advanced data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and machine learning-based classification to facilitate meaningful insights from genomic data.

## 🚀 Features
- *Intuitive File Upload*: Supports CSV genomic datasets
- *Data Preprocessing*: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables
- *Dimensionality Reduction*: Implements PCA & t-SNE for visualization
- *Feature Selection*: Utilizes the Chi-Square test for key feature identification
- *Machine Learning Model*: Trains a Random Forest Classifier for prediction
- *Performance Metrics*: Displays accuracy scores and classification reports
- *Interactive Visualization*: Graphical representations of PCA and t-SNE transformations

## 🛠 Setup & Installation
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
